## Climate Literacy Guide Removed from Climate.gov

**Script 2: Climate Literacy**

> “Hi, I’m [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [AREA NAME].
>
> I'm calling to urge [REP NAME] to take action to protect and restore environmental data on government websites. I was appalled to learn that the 2024 Climate Literacy Guide was recently removed from climate.gov. That guide provided authoritative information on the subject of Climate Change and linked to other substantial sources covering this topic. And it is just one example of the Trump administration’s war on environmental education. I ask that [REP NAME] speak out against it.
