# Data Rescue Event Planning Toolkit

## Event Format

We designed our event to be a drop-in style program centered around several activity stations. Our goal was to reach an audience with ranging interests, background knowledge, and technical skill sets. Given these parameters—and the practical challenges of planning an event at the end of the semester—we opted to focus our efforts in the following areas:

- Providing an introduction to web archiving and data rescue  
- Offering information about how people can advocate for the preservation and stewardship of federal research data  
- Introducing one easy-to-use tool for web archiving  
- Sharing resources and information for further exploration

## Organizing the Event and Coordinating Volunteers

We structured our event around several activity stations, each led by different library staff members. The goal was to keep each station’s activities under 15 minutes to encourage drop-in attendance.

- **Welcoming Crew**: Several staff members were stationed at various entry points to greet attendees, explain the event structure, and answer general questions.  
- **Resource Station**: Two staff members introduced attendees to a range of data rescue resources and also answered basic questions. A smartboard displayed a list of useful links.  
- **Lightning Talks Station**: Two staff members gave short lightning talks on various data rescue topics.  
- **Web Archiving Station**: Several staff members and a student led a hands-on tutorial on web archiving using Conifer.  
  [See our Conifer tutorial for more information.](https://github.com/HCDigitalScholarship/Datarescue/blob/main/README.md)  
- **Advocacy Station**: Several staff members provided resources for contacting elected officials to advocate for data stewardship and helped participants make buttons.

## Outreach

We focused our outreach efforts in several key areas, posting the event on the College’s listservs, event listing platforms, and social media. We also reached out directly to faculty, staff, and student organizations with related interests.

**Subject: Invitation to [Event Name]: Join us for data rescue and web archiving**

Dear [Name],  

I’m writing to invite you to **[sponsoring organization]**’s *[name of event]*, and to ask for your help in promoting it to **[your department, students, colleagues, etc.]**.

Information about the environment is rapidly disappearing from federally managed websites.  
Datasets on climate change, environmental justice, extreme weather events, and communities at risk of toxic hazards — data that researchers around the world have relied on for decades — are suddenly inaccessible or simply gone.

Archivists and librarians are fighting back by rescuing this vital information and keeping it safe, reliable, and accessible.  
In honor of Earth Month, the Libraries are hosting a workshop to inform the Haverford community about the importance of federally funded climate data and methods of archiving it.

No prior technical experience is needed; participants will explore various data and web archiving techniques and learn more about the importance of federally funded research data, particularly in environmental, climate, and other scientific fields.  
Laptops are not required but can be helpful to have for some portions of the event.

Attached are some graphics you can post to social media along with the following event details:

- **Event Title**  
- **Location** (with link to it on a map)  
- **Time and Date** *(drop-ins welcome – come when you can, go when you please.)*

Thanks so much for your help!
